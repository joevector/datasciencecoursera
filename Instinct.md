## Chapter I
### Under the microscope
##### What is the harder thing?
Imagine yourself facing your willpower challenge and doing the harder thing. What makes it hard?
##### Meet your two minds.
For your willpower challenge, describe your two competing selves. What does the impulsive version of you want? What does the wiser version of you want?
### Willpower experiments
##### Track your willpower choices
For at least one day, try to notice every decision you make related to your willpower challenge.
##### Five-minute brain-training meditation
Focus on your breath using the words "inhale" and "exhale" in your mind. When your mind wanders, notice, and bring it back to the breath.
##Chapter II
Willpower, like stress, is a biological instinct which evolved to protect us from ourselves.
### Under the microscope
##### What is the threat?
For your willpower challenge, identify the inner impulse that needs to be restrained rather than focusing on the external temptation.
##### Stress and self-control
Notice when stress strikes throughout the day or week and watch what happens to your self-control. Do you experience cravings? Lose your temper? Put off things you know you should do?
### Willpower experiments
##### Breathe your way to self-control
Slow down your breathing to 4-6 breaths per minute to shift into the physiological state of self-control.
##### The five-minute green willpower fill-up
Get active outdoors (even just a walk around the block) to reduce stress, improve your mood and boost motivation.
##### Zzzzzzz
Undo the effects of sleep deprivation with a nap or one good night's sleep.
##### Relax to restore your willpower reserve
Lie down, breathe deeply and let the physiological relaxation response help you recover from the demands of self-control and daily stress.
